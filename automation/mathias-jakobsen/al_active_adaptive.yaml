  name: Automatic Lighting - Active (Adaptive)
  description: |
    Uses the 'Automatic Lighting' integration to create a profile that will turn on lighting when a trigger is triggered.
    This will use the values of an Adaptive Lighting entity to set the brightness and color (in kelvin) of the lights.
